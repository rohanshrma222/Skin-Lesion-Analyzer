The three subgroups may look different dermatoscopically, but we grouped them together because they are similar biologically and often reported under the same generic term histopathologically.</p>

                            <p>Three things are needed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Collaboration with a dermatologist/pathologist.</li>
                                <li>More high quality labeled training data.</li>
                                <li>Field testing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>AI systems can be brittle. Good training scores don't guarantee that a model will perform well under real-world conditions. This tool first needs to be field tested. Then the model needs to be re-trained to make it more robust.</p>
